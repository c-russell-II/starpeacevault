Tusken Berserker

Met on Tatooine. I think.

He's defined almost entirely by his endlessly boisterous, lackadaisical attitude, and his propensity for bashing people over the head with his Gaffi stick, and never dying even when he **really, really should.**

He punched [Travis](Ooben Yaryu) out on their first meeting.

Regularly drinks himself to distraction when there isn't anything fun going on, and the expenses of this [[Muri]] will sometimes include in the [[Colony]] budget as "sundry expenses," "collateral damage coverage," and "punitive damages due to insufficient violence."
