As a self proclaimed scholar of the Infinite, I travel the universe in search of oddities in the force. My journey began when I left my home on Alpheridies after graduating from [[Hulis University]]
Through working jobs on the side and saving money since I was a child, I had managed to buy a starfighter and have it repaired good for flight by the time I graduated. With 1000credits to my name I left the system in search of anything that felt interesting. After traveling for 3 years and exploring different planets, having to work through sith and republic controlled areas, I stumbled across a weird light in the force and began to investigate the source. 
This light lead me to the colony system run by [[The Party]] witch I had not yet joined at the time, and my meeting with [[Tez]]. After waking up I asked if i could stay on the planet and investigate the force anomaly in response I was invited to tag along on a mission to reclaim an ancient Mandalorian ruin and explore, I had nothing to do so I agreed, and that was the point in witch i joined the party (I was in after Tez knocked me out).
