Rattattaki Sith Lord

Met on [[Tatooine]], where she had been sent by the [[Phoenecian]] to either retrieve or kill [[Tasha]] - whose importance, and intellect, had been recognized during her stint as a materials scientist. Unbeknownst to her master, her belief in the tenets of the [[sith]] had been growing shakier - leading her on a path towards the light that was rapidly and very thoroughly derailed by the party. Now, she acts as heavy magical support and one of the more flexible combat members of the party. Her dynamic with [[Aurelian]] can best be described as "every stage of an enemies-to-lovers story at the same time," and with [[Travis]] she maintains an odd tension between fearful disdain and a very deep-seated respect, which primarily manifests as anger and aggression masking fear and camaraderie.
